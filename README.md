Inspired by  @Evgeny Shvarov  and his recent article      
__[Deploying InterSystems IRIS Embedded Python Solutions with ZPM Package Manager](https://community.intersystems.com/post/deploying-intersystems-iris-embedded-python-solutions-zpm-package-manager)__   
I propagated the idea forward to do the same also for modules in Node.js.  
The case is based on my example of [IRIS Native API for Node.js](https://community.intersystems.com/post/websocket-client-js-iris-native-api-docker-micro-server)    

__UPDATE__  
- All additional __required__ Node.js components can now be installed at runtime.  
  Only _intersystems-iris-native_ module is pre-installed during Docker build.    
- When Node.js is launched its Process id is displayed for debugging purpose. 
- Some optical cosmetics and runtime improvements.  

~~With Node.js you face the challenge to install additional __required__ components that need to be  
installed with sufficient privileges using __npm__.~~  
This step and adjusting access rights are covered in Dockerfile.  
But all your .js modules are handled by ZPM.

The logic of the example hasn't changed.  
- the Nodes.js service is started  
- the selected address of the echo server is passed to it > __E__  
- you compose the text to be transmitted > __N__  
- you send it and see how the replies are dropping in > __S__    
- stop service  and exit > __X__    

Different from the original example, the service is now running in background.  
So its output is invisible but writes a log file that can be view by the action > __L__

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

## Installation 

Clone/git pull this repo into any local directory
```
$ git clone https://github.com/isc-at/ZPM-for-Node.js 
```

Open the terminal in this directory and run:
```
$ docker-compose build
```
this may take some time to complete

Run the IRIS container with this project:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## How to Test it

Using IRIS terminal:
```
$ docker-compose exec iris iris session iris "##class(rccjs.WSockNodeJs).Run()"
